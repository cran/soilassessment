\title{
A function for assessing stoniness suitability requirements for certain crops
}
\description{
This function determines the suitability classes for stoniness requirements of selected agricultural crops
}
\usage{
stoneSuit(value, crop)
}
\arguments{
  \item{value}{
Input level of stoniness in percent.
}
\item{crop}{
The crop of interest for which stoniness suitability class is sought.
}
}
\details{
The input value can be map or just a numerical entry of stoniness in percent
}
\value{
The output is stoniness suitability class for the crop. The output is an integer value for suitability class: 1- highly suitable; 2 - moderately suitable; 3 - marginally suitable; 4 - currently not suitable; 5 - not suitable
