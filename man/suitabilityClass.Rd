\title{
A function to determine suitability classes for given indicator values
}
\description{
This function determines the suitability class to which a given indicator value falls based on the crop requirement
}
\usage{
suitabilityClass(value,crop,factor)
}
\arguments{
  \item{value}{
Input indicator value.
}
\item{crop}{
The crop of interest for which suitability is determined.
}
\item{factor}{
The suitability factor for crop requirement. Example factors include: rain, slope, carbonate, EC, ESP, depth, ph, temperature,
}
}
\value{
The output is rainfall suitability class for the crop. The output is integer value for suitability class: 1- highly suitable; 2 - moderately suitable; 3 - marginally suitable; 4 - currently not suitable; 5 - not suitable
