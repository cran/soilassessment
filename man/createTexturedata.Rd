\title{
A function for creating spatial dataframe of normalized soil texture proportions
}
\description{
The function creates spatial dataframe of normalized soil texture proportions. They are normalized to 100 percent
}
\usage{
createTexturedata(clay,silt,sand)
}

\arguments{
  \item{clay}{
clay proportion of soil texture in percent
}
 \item{silt}{
silt proportion of soil texture in percent
}
 \item{sand}{
sand proportion of soil texture in percent
}
}
\details{
the input data of soil texture proportions are imported into R as spatial raster or dataframe. They need to have uniform coordinate reference system (CRS) and same pixel size (resolution) if in raster map format. The sum of the proportions should be close to 100 per cent for each row
}
\value{
The output is a spatial pixel dataframe of normalized soil texture proportions (for each pixel)

\note{
It's important to ensure the input data does not have negative values nor add up to far below or above 100 per cent. It's also important to adhere to the order of the input data: clay, silt, sand
