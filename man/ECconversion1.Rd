\title{
A function for correcting electrical conductivity of soil solution to that of saturated paste extract
}
\description{
This function converts electrical conductivity measurements of a soil solution to that of soil paste extract. It considers the influence of texture, organic matter content, and clay content on electrical conductivity conversion. These factors and ratio of soil:water mix for the solution and conversion method must be indicated.
}
\usage{
ECconversion1(ec,oc,clay,texture,soilsolution, method)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ec}{
measured electrical conductivity of the soil solution
}
 \item{oc}{
organic matter content of the soil in percent
}
 \item{clay}{
clay content of the soil in percent
}
 \item{texture}{
soil textural class according to USDA or its equivalent. Texture class is given in terms of class codes as given in classnames("texture")
}
 \item{soilsolution}{
ratio of soil:water mix when electrical conductivity was measured. Example is 1:1, 1:2, etc. The default is 1:1
}
 \item{method}{
method for converting electrical conductivity of the soil:water mix to that of the soil paste extract. The methods included are FAO, sonmez, and hogg. The default is FAO
