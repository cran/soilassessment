\title{
A function to estimate rainfall erosivity from annual rainfall amounts
}
\description{
This function assumes an algebraic relationship between annual rainfall amounts and rainfall erosivity. The relationship has constants that may depend of certain regions.
}
\usage{
erosivFUN(rain,A,B, model)
}
\arguments{
  \item{rain}{
annual rainfall amounts in mm or Fourier index of rainfall
}
 \item{A}{
independent constant of the algebraic relationship between rainfall mounts and erosive energy (Energy=A+-B*rainfall)
}
 \item{B}{
rainfall coefficient of the algebraic relationship between rainfall mounts and erosive energy (Energy=A+-B*rainfall)
}
 \item{model}{
model defining the algebraic relationship between rainfall mounts and erosive energy. The model can be linear, power, logarithmic, Fourier, and exponential
}
}
\value{
rainfall erosivity in MJ mm/ha/hr/yr
