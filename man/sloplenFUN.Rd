\title{
A function for estimating slope-length factor for soil erosion
}
\description{
Th function estimates slope length factor for erosion risk assessment. It has options for choosing different algorithms
}
\usage{
sloplenFUN(ls,slope,method)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ls}{
length of slope in metres
}
 \item{slope}{
slope of land in degrees
}
 \item{method}{
method for deriving slope-length factor. The methods included are: WSmith, Renard, Remortel, Zhang, Nearing, Smith, Foster, David, Morgan, and Moore.
}
}
\details{
Slope (degrees) and length of slope (metres) are relief parameters in erosion risk assessment.
}
\value{
a dimensionless quantity of slope-length factor of erosion risk
