Description: Soil assessment builds information for improved decision in soil management. It analyzes soil conditions with regard to agriculture 
        crop suitability requirements [such as those given by FAO <http://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/crop-information/en/>] soil fertility classes, 
        soil erosion models and soil salinity classification. Suitability requirements are for crops  grouped into cereal crops, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables, 
        industrial crops, and root crops.
