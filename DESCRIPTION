Title: Assessment Models for Agriculture Soil Conditions and Crop
        Suitability
Version: 0.2.4
Description: Soil assessment builds information for improved decision in
    soil management. It analyzes soil conditions with regard to
    agriculture crop suitability requirements [such as those given by FAO
    <https://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/crop-information/en/>]
    soil fertility classes, soil erosion, and soil salinity classification
    [<doi:10.1002/ldr.4211>]. Suitability requirements are for
    crops grouped into cereal crops, nuts, legumes, fruits, vegetables,
    industrial crops, and root crops.
