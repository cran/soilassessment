Title: Soil Health Assessment Models for Assessing Soil Conditions and
        Suitability
Version: 0.3.1
Description: Soil health assessment builds information to improve decision in
    soil management. It facilitates assessment of soil conditions for crop suitability [such as those given by FAO
    <https://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/crop-information/en/>], 
    groundwater recharge, fertility, erosion, salinization [<doi:10.1002/ldr.4211>],
